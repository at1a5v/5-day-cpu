Hi! Throughout this blog/guide I'll be documenting my experiences in learning about, and designing basic CPUs. I have near 0 experience so it might be a bit messy at times but that's all part of the journey!

Some resources I'll be referring to throughout this include:
 - https://nanohub.org/groups/chipshub/
 - https://www.falstad.com/circuit/
 - https://www.falstad.com/circuit/doc/
 - and other sites which I'll add to this list as I find more

The goal is to complete the design and implementation of a working chip within a ~5 day cycle! (might be a long shot but we'll see!)

Thanks for stopping by! - at1a5v
